Hey ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š, Iâ€™m building a Rockstar Games website clone using React.js and Tailwind! Itâ€™s going to have all those sleek game showcases, cool animations, and a responsive layout, just like the real thing. Tailwind makes styling super fast, and React helps with dynamic content, so it's gonna look amazing on all devices!
